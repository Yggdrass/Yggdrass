# PORTFOLIO


### ***Front-End Developer | Designer***

My name is Audun Roald. I am 41 years old and have previously worked as a kindergarden teacher and educational leader in a couple of kindergardens since 2011. Before that I studied archeology, history and early childhood development in Trondheim from 2003 to 2011.
In february 2020 I got exhausted from work and went on sick leave for a while. After almost a year of this I started to study Front End development at Noroff, with online classes and frm home. So from 2021 until 2023 I have studied coding and web design.

My energy levels have been up and down since I still have to be careful not to overwork myself again. So the projects have been of various quality, but I am proud of all that I have created. I had no knowledge of coding before I started, so my learning cureve have been steep. I'm a perfectionist and therefore I want to continuosly better myself and learn. So I'm sort of proud of what I have created, but everytime I go back to view the projects over, I see that I can improve the design and coding. So I can both be proud of what I have created and see that I am learning.

## Coding Practices

### Javascript

- **JSDOCS** **:**
I use JSDOCS when writing a function in Javascript. This is so others can see what the function is supposed top do and what params etc to put in each area of the function for it tow work.



- **NAMING** **:**
When naming folders, files or codie within files, I use fully and suitable names. 
  For instance: ***auth*** = ❌ **|** ***authorization*** = ✅
Also the names can either have camelCase ("loginFunction.js") or underscores ("login_function.js"). I can use both, but will only stick to one of these on a single project. But I am able to use both and I think that both have equally merit so if an employer or client wants it written in either I am adaptable. Naming the functions within a file I always use "camelCase", and if a single function has its own file I name that file the exact same as the function itself. For instance: Function in a file -> ***loginUser();*** | Filename -> ***loginUser.js***.



- **TESTING** :

**Unit tests :** Unit-test-files with Jest I always put in the same folder as the JS-file that it tests. When testing the file ***login.js*** the testfile is named ***login.test.js***. This makes it quicker and easier for the testfile to find the file it is testing, and it is more understandable for the coder to work with both files. I believe that having a seperate folder fo all tests makes it harder for the coder to work with the tests and takes up more time since they need to navigate back and forth between folders instead of having both files in the same folder.

**E2E tests :** Testing functionality is best done with real people testing the app in real time. But it can be a good idea to do E2E testing before it is sent to QA to test. This way we can ensure that everything is working as it should be before real testing begins.


- **FOLDER STRUCTURE** :

I like to keep the folders and files as neat and tidy as possible, in order for the project to be easily readable and understandable.


- **REACT** :

In react I create a structure that is split into several main folders, like pages, CSS, components, assets, fonts etc. If there are several types of the same categories like for instance containers, I put them in the same css file called containers. This makes it easier to find all of them. If there are just a few containing to a single component or page, then I create a css-file of the same name and place it in the same folder as the jsx-file.
